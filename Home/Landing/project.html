What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create and design web pages by structuring and organizing content on the web. It uses elements and tags to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and other parts of a web page, allowing browsers to display content correctly. It forms the basic foundation of every website and works together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

Key points about HTML include:

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It is used to create web pages and web applications.
HTML is the most commonly used language on the web.
HTML is capable of creating static web pages.
It is a markup language and not a programming language.
Note: HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, because it does not contain logic, conditions, or loops. It's main purpose is to define the structure and layout of web content rather than to perform computations or decision-making.</p>
